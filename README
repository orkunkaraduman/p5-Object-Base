ABSTRACT
    Multi-threaded base class to establish a class deriving relationship
    with base classes at compile time

            package Foo;
            use Object::Base;
            attributes ':shared', 'attr1', 'attr2';
        
            package Bar;
            use Object::Base 'Foo';
            attributes 'attr3', ':shared' => undef, 'attr2' => undef;
        
            package main;
            use threads;
            use threads::shared;
        
            # object of Foo
            my $foo = Foo->new();
        
            # usage of attribute
            $foo->attr1(1);
            print $foo->attr1, "\n"; # prints '1'
        
            # attributes are also lvaluable
            $foo->attr1++;
            print $foo->attr1, "\n"; # prints '2'
        
            # class attributes, eg: ':shared'
            print "\$foo is ", is_shared($foo)? "shared": "not shared", "\n";
        
            # object of derived class Bar
            my $bar = Bar->new();
        
            # attributes can be added derived classes
            $bar->attr3(3);
        
            # attributes are inheritable
            $bar->attr1(3);
        
            # attributes are overridable #1
            eval { $bar->attr2 = 4 }; print $@; # prints error 'Attribute attr2 is not defined in Bar at ...'
        
            # attributes are overridable #2
            print "\$bar is ", is_shared($bar)? "shared": "not shared", "\n"; # prints '$bar is not shared'
        
            # assigning ref values to shared class attributes
            eval { $foo->attr2 = { key1 => 'val1' } }; print $@; # prints error 'Invalid value for shared scalar at ...'
            $foo->attr2({ key2 => 'val2' }); # uses shared_clone assigning ref value
